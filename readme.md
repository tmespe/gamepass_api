# Gamepass catalogue data

This library provides a way to download data about the gamepass catalogue with data from the Xbox store and 
Opencritic including review scores. The aim of the project is to create a tool that 
can be used to analyze the Gamepass library and provide an interface for automating Gamepass
summaries. Currently it provides a way to download data to a csv file.

## Future Development

Work is in progress on creating a pipeline with a database and FastAPI endpoint, as well as getting review data from Metacritic.
