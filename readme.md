# Gamepass library API

This library provides an API for the gamepass catalogue with data from the Xbox store and 
Opencritic including review scores. The aim of the project is to create an API that 
can be used to analyze the Gamepass library and provide an interface for automating Gamepass
summaries. It uses FastApi along with a sqlite database. A Pandas notebook is included as a starting point.
